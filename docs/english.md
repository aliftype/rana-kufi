_Rana Kufi_ (كوفي رنا) is a Fatimid [Kufic][1] that follows the Fatimid Kufic rules and
measurements pioneered by the late master of Arabic calligraphy [_Mohammad
Abdul Qadir_][2].

_Rana Kufi_ is a free and open source project, any one is welcomed to use and
modify it under the terms of the [version 3 of GNU Affero General Public
License][4].

_Rana Kufi_ can be seen as a tool to be used by calligraphers and designers to make Fatimid Kufic artwork and designs, so it tends to provide as much as possible glyph alternates to gives it user enough freedom and flexibility to realize the desired design. This comes at the expense of increased complexity in using the font, and requires its users to be aware of the rules and subtleties of Fatimid Kufic, so its advised to refer to the relevant resources on Fatimid Kufic, _Mohammad Abdul Qadir’s_ book on Arabic calligraphy.

_Rana Kufi_ is still under construction.

The app
-------

The font provides many alternate shapes for many of its glyphs, which should be
usable in any OpenType-savvy application. But since many apps have poor
OpenType support, or bad UI, or don’t allow controlling features for single
glyphs, _Rana Kufi_ comes with a web application that provides easy access to
glyph alternates.
