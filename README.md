_Rana Kufi_ (كوفي رنا) is a Fatimid [Kufic][1] that follows the Fatimid Kufic rules and
measurements poineered by the late master of Arabic calligraphy [_Mohammad
Abdul Qadir_][2].

_Rana Kufi_ is a free and open source project, any one is welcomed to use and
modify it under the terms of the [version 3 of GNU Affero General Public
License][4].

The app
-------

The font provides many alternate shapes for many of its glyphs, which should be
usable in any OpenType-savvy application. But since many apps have poor
OpenType support, or bad UI, or don’t allow controlling features for single
glyphs, _Rana Kufi_ comes with a web application that provides easy access to
glyph alternates.
